<h1>Cronulla Sharks
</h1>
<p>The cronulla sharks was founded in 1963 under the banner of Cronulla-Caringbah. They entered the inter-district competition, playing against Wentworthville, Sydney University, Penrith and other clubs in the Sydney area. They debuted in 1967 wearing a sky blue jersey adorned with a white V and red numbers on the back. After the 2016 season in which the Sharks finished third, they went on to defeat the Raiders in the Week 1 qualifying final 16-14 and earn the week off. Advancing to the Preliminary final, they defeated defending premiers North Queensland Cowboys 32-20 at Allianz Stadium. They would face and defeat the Melbourne Storm in the 2016 NRL Grand Final. The Sharks, after leading 8-0 at half-time, ended up winning 14-12 to claim their first premiership in the club's 50-year history. Sharks second rower Luke Lewis was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as Man of the Match. The cronulla sharks theme song is Up, up, Cronulla,
the boys in the black white and blue.
Up, up, Cronulla,
name of the sharks fits you.
Sharks, sharks, forever
go out and play without fear.
Now’s the time to see good football,
cause the sharks are here!
Up the sharks! When the Sharks entered the competition in 1967, they played their home games at Sutherland Oval. They only played there for two seasons with the Sharks winning their first game at the ground on 22 April [1967 NSWRFL season]. The record attendance for Sutherland Oval was set in the last Cronulla game played at the ground when 12,578 saw the Sharks go down 32–4 to on 16 June 1968,Overall the Sharks compiled a record of 4 wins, 11 losses and 1 draw at the venue. In 1967 the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) added two new clubs to the competition, Cronulla-Sutherland and Penrith, the first to join the competition since Parramatta and Manly were admitted 20 years earlier.
